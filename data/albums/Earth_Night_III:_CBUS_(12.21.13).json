    "description": "On December 20th and 21st, 2012 - a monumental convergence of like-minded individuals from across nations and borders was born. Caught in the midst of prophecies from across cultures concerning the 'end of time', people across the Earth asked important questions about who we are as a people and where we are going. While some anticipated catastrophe, others attempted collective activation into a new paradigm that would shift the ways in which we spend on our time on this planet. Across the globe people gathered and ignited their will to continue their work here on Earth through music, art, activism and prayers. \r\n\r\nDeep in the heartlands of America, a small group of musicians, artists and spiritual activists organized a gathering that spanned across these two days and included a variety of experience from live music to art, workshops, presentations and more. Inspired by the progressive spirit of the internationally-known and celebrated Earth Day (originally founded on the spring equinox in 1969) - this group named the event Earth Night - a testament to the power of global unification as well as the extended darkness offered by the winter solstice - the longest night of every year. Much like Earth Day, Earth Night rooted itself in the ever-growing environmental movement while taking time to recognize some of the practices of old that connected us to our planet in ways we hardly have the language for today. \r\n\r\nEarth Night returned this December 20th and 21st to the Lifestyle Communities Pavilion for a 2-night celebration of music, art and spirit. Featuring 2 nights of Papadosio, an internationally acclaimed music lineup, as well as day-long workshop series. \r\n\r\nHere is Papadosio's performance from night 2 plus bonus photos including a high-res version of the official Earth Night 2K13 poster, a look at the painting created by Morgan Mandala and Randal Roberts over the course of the weekend, plus the Amazon Research and Conservation Center Video IndieGogo that was played just before the final encore of the weekend.
