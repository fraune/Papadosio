    "description": "\"Empty, Clear, and Quiet.\" Papadosio release their second collaboration with Ram Dass, \"The Antidote For Fear\". The deep and humble words in this incredible talk were interpreted musically during a studio improvisation. The music is intended to sonically illustrate a journey from being in a state of fear to a state of what Ram Dass calls, \"spacious awareness\". \"Fear will have no new faces, fear has emptied out its bag of tricks, and still there is the human heart that seeks to see love.\""
